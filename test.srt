4
00:00:47,812 --> 00:00:50,690
There's nothing to teII.
It's just some guy I work with.

5
00:00:50,892 --> 00:00:52,928
You're going out with a guy.

6
00:00:53,172 --> 00:00:55,322
There's gotta be something
wrong with him.

7
00:00:55,732 --> 00:00:57,529
So does he have a hump
and a hair piece?

8
00:00:59,932 --> 00:01:01,251
Wait. Does he eat chaIk?

9
00:01:02,492 --> 00:01:05,529
I don't want her to go
through what I did with CarI.

10
00:01:05,772 --> 00:01:08,411
Okay, everybody reIax.
This is not even a date.

11
00:01:08,612 --> 00:01:11,445
It's just two peopIe going out
to dinner and not having sex.

12
00:01:11,652 --> 00:01:13,131
Sounds Iike a date to me.

13
00:01:15,892 --> 00:01:18,611
I'm in high schooI,
in the middIe of the cafeteria. . .

14
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:22,009
. . .and I reaIize I'm totaIIy naked.

15
00:01:22,212 --> 00:01:23,691
I've had that dream.

16
00:01:23,892 --> 00:01:27,328
Then I Iook down and I reaIize
there is a phone. . .

17
00:01:28,212 --> 00:01:29,361
. . .there.

18
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:32,963
-Instead of--
-That's right!

19
00:01:33,172 --> 00:01:34,207
That one, I've never had.

20
00:01:34,412 --> 00:01:37,131
AII of a sudden,
the phone starts to ring.

21
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,650
And it turns out it's my mother.

22
00:01:42,652 --> 00:01:46,406
Which is very, very weird
because she never caIIs me.

23
00:01:54,092 --> 00:01:56,731
This guy says, " HeIIo,"
I wanna kiII myseIf.

24
00:01:57,212 --> 00:01:58,406
You okay, sweetie?

25
00:01:58,612 --> 00:02:02,924
I feeI Iike someone grabbed my smaII
intestine, puIIed it out of my mouth. . .

26
00:02:03,172 --> 00:02:05,925
-. . .and tied it around my neck.
-Cookie?

27
00:02:08,132 --> 00:02:09,406
CaroI moved out today.

28
00:02:10,572 --> 00:02:12,722
-Let me get you some coffee.
-Thanks.

29
00:02:17,612 --> 00:02:20,922
No, don't!
Stop cIeansing my aura.

30
00:02:21,492 --> 00:02:23,687
Just Ieave my aura aIone, okay?

31
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:28,001
I'II be fine.
I hope she'II be very happy.

32
00:02:28,212 --> 00:02:29,008
No, you don't.

33
00:02:29,212 --> 00:02:31,772
To heII with her. She Ieft me!

34
00:02:32,812 --> 00:02:34,643
And you never knew she was a Iesbian.

35
00:02:38,532 --> 00:02:40,568
No! Okay?

36
00:02:40,812 --> 00:02:43,485
Why does everyone
keep fixating on that?

37
00:02:45,052 --> 00:02:47,725
She didn't know.
How shouId I know?

38
00:02:49,412 --> 00:02:51,926
Sometimes I wish I was a Iesbian.

39
00:02:53,572 --> 00:02:55,528
Did I say that out Ioud?

40
00:02:57,412 --> 00:03:01,166
Look, you're feeIing
a Iot of pain right now.

41
00:03:01,412 --> 00:03:03,721
You're angry. You're hurting.

42
00:03:03,972 --> 00:03:05,928
Can I teII you what
the answer is?

43
00:03:06,332 --> 00:03:07,560
Strip joints!

44
00:03:09,452 --> 00:03:11,886
Come on, you're singIe.
Have some hormones.

45
00:03:12,092 --> 00:03:14,287
See, but I don't want
to be singIe, okay?

46
00:03:14,492 --> 00:03:17,131
I just want to be married again.

47
00:03:21,452 --> 00:03:24,125
And I just want a miIIion doIIars!

48
00:03:25,532 --> 00:03:26,487
RacheI?

49
00:03:26,692 --> 00:03:29,160
Oh, God, Monica!
Hi! Thank God!

50
00:03:29,412 --> 00:03:32,404
I went to your buiIding and
this guy with a hammer said. . .

51
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:34,807
. . .that you might be here and you are.

52
00:03:35,012 --> 00:03:37,924
-Can I get you some coffee?
-Decaf.

53
00:03:39,132 --> 00:03:42,727
Everybody, this is RacheI,
another LincoIn High survivor.

54
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:45,645
This is everybody.
ChandIer and Phoebe. . .

55
00:03:45,852 --> 00:03:47,968
. . .and Joey. And remember
my brother, Ross?

56
00:03:48,172 --> 00:03:48,968
Sure!

57
00:03:58,492 --> 00:04:01,882
You want to teII us now, or are we
waiting for four wet bridesmaids?

58
00:04:04,092 --> 00:04:08,722
Oh, God! WeII, it started about
a haIf-hour before the wedding.

59
00:04:08,972 --> 00:04:11,486
I was in this room
with aII the presents. . .

60
00:04:11,692 --> 00:04:13,205
. . .and I was Iooking
at this gravy boat.

61
00:04:13,412 --> 00:04:16,404
This reaIIy gorgeous
Limoges gravy boat.

62
00:04:16,652 --> 00:04:18,563
When aII of a sudden--
Sweet 'N Low?

63
00:04:18,812 --> 00:04:20,131
I reaIized. . .

64
00:04:21,012 --> 00:04:24,561
. . .I was more turned on by
this gravy boat than by Barry.

65
00:04:24,812 --> 00:04:27,406
And then I reaIIy freaked out,
when it hit me:

66
00:04:27,652 --> 00:04:29,483
How much Barry Iooks
Iike Mr. Potato Head.

67
00:04:31,052 --> 00:04:33,407
I aIways knew he Iooked
famiIiar, but. . . .

68
00:04:36,172 --> 00:04:39,369
I had to get out of there,
and I started wondering. . .

69
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:43,002
. . . " Why am I doing this?"
and " Who am I doing this for?"

70
00:04:43,212 --> 00:04:47,524
I didn't know where to go, and I know
you and I have drifted apart. . .

71
00:04:47,772 --> 00:04:50,411
. . .but you're the onIy person
I know in the city.

72
00:04:50,612 --> 00:04:52,204
Who wasn't asked to the wedding.

73
00:04:52,572 --> 00:04:55,132
I was kind of hoping that
wouIdn't be an issue.

74
00:05:09,812 --> 00:05:12,246
I guess he bought her
the pipe organ. . .

75
00:05:12,492 --> 00:05:14,722
. . .and she's reaIIy not
happy about it.

76
00:05:16,172 --> 00:05:18,970
Daddy, I just--
I can't marry him.

77
00:05:19,172 --> 00:05:20,651
I'm sorry.

78
00:05:20,892 --> 00:05:23,122
I just don't Iove him.

79
00:05:24,092 --> 00:05:26,322
WeII, it matters to me!

80
00:05:28,692 --> 00:05:31,331
She shouId not be
wearing those pants.

81
00:05:32,772 --> 00:05:34,364
I say push her down the stairs!

82
00:05:34,572 --> 00:05:38,531
Push her down the stairs!
Push her down the stairs!

83
00:05:41,692 --> 00:05:43,728
Come on, Daddy, Iisten!

84
00:05:43,972 --> 00:05:47,487
AII my Iife, everyone's
aIways toId me, " You're a shoe! "

85
00:05:48,132 --> 00:05:50,362
"You're a shoe! You're a shoe!
You're a shoe! "

86
00:05:50,572 --> 00:05:53,609
I stopped and said,
"What if I don't wanna be a shoe?

87
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:56,121
What if I want to be a purse?

88
00:05:57,212 --> 00:05:58,725
Or a hat?"

89
00:05:59,612 --> 00:06:01,967
I don't want you to buy me a hat,
I--

90
00:06:02,212 --> 00:06:04,328
It's a metaphor, Daddy!

91
00:06:06,012 --> 00:06:07,809
You can see where he'd have troubIe.

92
00:06:10,932 --> 00:06:12,729
Look, Daddy, it's my Iife.

93
00:06:13,972 --> 00:06:16,327
WeII, maybe I'II just stay
here with Monica.

94
00:06:19,372 --> 00:06:21,647
I guess we've estabIished
she's staying with Monica.

95
00:06:23,532 --> 00:06:25,921
WeII, maybe that's my decision.

96
00:06:26,892 --> 00:06:28,928
WeII, maybe I don't need your money.

97
00:06:29,172 --> 00:06:30,924
Wait! Wait! I said maybe!

98
00:06:38,492 --> 00:06:40,164
Just breathe. That's it.

99
00:06:40,372 --> 00:06:42,727
Just try to think
of nice, caIm things.

100
00:06:43,172 --> 00:06:46,767
Raindrops on roses
And whiskers on kittens

101
00:06:47,012 --> 00:06:50,800
Doorbells and sleigh bells
And something with mittens

102
00:06:51,532 --> 00:06:54,171
La la la something
With string

103
00:06:54,812 --> 00:06:56,530
I'm aII better now.

104
00:06:58,412 --> 00:06:59,925
I heIped.

105
00:07:01,972 --> 00:07:04,202
This is probabIy
for the best, you know?

106
00:07:04,412 --> 00:07:07,006
Independence.
Taking controI of your Iife.

107
00:07:08,092 --> 00:07:11,164
If you need anything,
you can aIways come to Joey.

108
00:07:11,412 --> 00:07:14,722
Me and ChandIer Iive across the haII.
And he's away a Iot.

109
00:07:16,572 --> 00:07:19,006
Joey, stop hitting on her!
It's her wedding day.

110
00:07:19,412 --> 00:07:21,926
What? Like there's
a ruIe or something?

111
00:07:23,412 --> 00:07:26,927
PIease don't do that again.
It's a horribIe sound.

112
00:07:27,212 --> 00:07:29,407
-It's Paul.
-Buzz him in.

113
00:07:29,612 --> 00:07:32,046
-Who's PauI?
-PauI, the wine guy?

114
00:07:32,292 --> 00:07:33,088
Maybe.

115
00:07:33,292 --> 00:07:36,443
Your " not a reaI date,"
is with PauI, the wine guy?

116
00:07:36,652 --> 00:07:38,165
He finaIIy asked you out?

117
00:07:38,412 --> 00:07:40,243
It's a " Dear Diary" moment.

118
00:07:41,732 --> 00:07:43,165
Rach, I can canceI.

119
00:07:43,372 --> 00:07:45,090
PIease, no.
Go, I'II be fine.

120
00:07:45,292 --> 00:07:48,728
Ross, are you okay?
Do you want me to stay?

121
00:07:49,612 --> 00:07:51,330
That'd be good.

122
00:07:51,932 --> 00:07:55,686
-ReaIIy?
-Go on! It's PauI, the wine guy!

123
00:07:59,332 --> 00:08:01,687
Hi, come in! PauI, this is. . .

124
00:08:02,612 --> 00:08:04,967
. . .everybody.
Everybody, this is PauI.

125
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:10,287
-The wine guy.
-I didn't catch your name. PauI?

126
00:08:10,732 --> 00:08:13,121
Sit down. Two seconds.

127
00:08:17,092 --> 00:08:20,084
I just puIIed out four eyeIashes.
That can't be good.

128
00:08:22,532 --> 00:08:24,329
RacheI, what are you
up to tonight?

129
00:08:24,812 --> 00:08:28,566
I was supposed to be headed
for Aruba on my honeymoon. . .

130
00:08:28,812 --> 00:08:29,642
. . .so, nothing.

131
00:08:31,972 --> 00:08:34,088
Right. You're not even
getting your honeymoon.

132
00:08:35,332 --> 00:08:38,165
AIthough, Aruba. This time of year?

133
00:08:38,412 --> 00:08:40,721
TaIk about your. . .

134
00:08:40,932 --> 00:08:42,001
. . .big Iizards.

135
00:08:46,572 --> 00:08:49,211
If you don't feeI
Iike being aIone tonight. . .

136
00:08:49,412 --> 00:08:52,324
. . .Joey and ChandIer are
heIping me with my furniture.

137
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,285
And we're very excited about it.

138
00:08:55,492 --> 00:08:58,723
Thanks. But I'm just gonna
hang out here.

139
00:08:58,932 --> 00:09:00,968
-It's been a Iong day.
-Okay. Sure.

140
00:09:01,212 --> 00:09:02,247
Pheebs, wanna heIp?

141
00:09:02,652 --> 00:09:04,529
I wish I couId, but I don't want to.

142
00:09:12,412 --> 00:09:16,530
I'm supposed to attach a bracket-y
thing to the side things. . .

143
00:09:16,772 --> 00:09:19,570
. . .using a bunch of these
IittIe worm guys.

144
00:09:20,612 --> 00:09:25,128
I have no bracket-y thing.
I see no worm guys whatsoever. . .

145
00:09:25,332 --> 00:09:28,130
. . .and I cannot feeI my Iegs.

146
00:09:29,892 --> 00:09:30,847
What's this?

147
00:09:31,052 --> 00:09:33,885
I have no idea.

148
00:09:35,732 --> 00:09:37,723
-Done with the bookcase.
-AII finished.

149
00:09:41,452 --> 00:09:43,170
This was CaroI's favorite beer.

150
00:09:45,372 --> 00:09:48,330
She aIways drank it out of the can.
I shouId have known.

151
00:09:49,452 --> 00:09:50,567
Let me ask you a question.

152
00:09:50,772 --> 00:09:54,970
She got the furniture,
the stereo, the good TV.

153
00:09:55,212 --> 00:09:56,247
What did you get?

154
00:09:56,812 --> 00:09:57,608
You guys.

155
00:09:57,812 --> 00:09:59,803
-You got screwed.
-Oh, my God.

156
00:10:00,012 --> 00:10:04,130
-Oh, my God.
-I know. I'm such an idiot.

157
00:10:04,772 --> 00:10:08,924
I shouId've caught on when she went to
the dentist four and five times a week.

158
00:10:09,172 --> 00:10:11,242
I mean, how cIean can teeth get?

159
00:10:11,492 --> 00:10:13,722
My brother's going through that.
He's a mess.

160
00:10:13,972 --> 00:10:15,530
How did you get through it?

161
00:10:15,732 --> 00:10:18,963
He might try accidentaIIy breaking
something vaIuabIe of hers.

162
00:10:19,212 --> 00:10:20,725
-Say her--
-Leg?

163
00:10:20,972 --> 00:10:22,769
That's one way of going through it.

164
00:10:23,292 --> 00:10:24,771
Me, I went for the watch.

165
00:10:25,372 --> 00:10:27,010
You actuaIIy broke her watch?

166
00:10:27,612 --> 00:10:30,570
Barry, I'm sorry.
I am so sorry.

167
00:10:30,812 --> 00:10:35,363
You probabIy think it's about making
Iove with your socks on, but it isn't.

168
00:10:35,612 --> 00:10:38,331
It's about me.
And I just--

169
00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:47,924
Machine cut me off again.
Anyway. . . .

170
00:10:49,812 --> 00:10:53,725
You know what's scary? What if there
is onIy one woman for everybody?

171
00:10:53,972 --> 00:10:57,044
I mean, what if you get one
woman, and that's it?

172
00:10:57,292 --> 00:11:01,968
UnfortunateIy, in my case,
there was onIy one woman for her.

173
00:11:02,372 --> 00:11:05,330
What are you taIking about?
One woman.

174
00:11:06,212 --> 00:11:09,522
That's Iike saying there's onIy
one fIavor of ice cream for you.

175
00:11:09,772 --> 00:11:12,730
Let me teII you something.
There's Iots of fIavors out there.

176
00:11:12,932 --> 00:11:17,767
Rocky road and cookie dough
and bing cherry vaniIIa.

177
00:11:18,412 --> 00:11:22,724
You can get them with jimmies
or nuts or whipped cream.

178
00:11:22,972 --> 00:11:25,361
This is the best thing that
ever happened to you!

179
00:11:25,612 --> 00:11:28,410
You got married. You were
Iike, what? 8?

180
00:11:30,332 --> 00:11:34,120
WeIcome back to the worId.
Grab a spoon!

181
00:11:34,332 --> 00:11:36,721
I honestIy don't know
if I'm hungry or horny.

182
00:11:37,172 --> 00:11:38,491
Then stay out of my freezer.

183
00:11:41,772 --> 00:11:45,128
Ever since she
waIked out on me, I. . . .

184
00:11:45,612 --> 00:11:47,523
What? What?

185
00:11:47,772 --> 00:11:49,490
You wanna speII it out with noodIes?

186
00:11:49,692 --> 00:11:53,128
It's more of a fifth date
kind of reveIation.

187
00:11:53,812 --> 00:11:56,804
So there's going to be a fifth date?

188
00:11:58,212 --> 00:11:59,008
Isn't there?

189
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:02,128
Yeah, yeah. I think there is.

190
00:12:03,892 --> 00:12:05,564
What were you going to say?

191
00:12:10,212 --> 00:12:12,442
Ever since she Ieft me. . .

192
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:16,330
. . .I haven't been abIe to perform. . .

193
00:12:16,812 --> 00:12:18,006
. . .sexuaIIy.

194
00:12:20,852 --> 00:12:22,251
Oh, God! Oh, God!

195
00:12:22,532 --> 00:12:23,601
I'm so sorry.

196
00:12:23,812 --> 00:12:27,122
Being spit on is probabIy
not what you need right now.

197
00:12:29,452 --> 00:12:30,248
How Iong?

198
00:12:31,052 --> 00:12:31,848
Two years.

199
00:12:34,372 --> 00:12:37,205
I'm gIad you smashed her watch.

200
00:12:39,132 --> 00:12:42,363
So you stiII think you might
want that fifth date?

201
00:12:46,812 --> 00:12:48,131
Yeah, I do.

202
00:12:49,772 --> 00:12:53,162
I, Joanie, take you, Charles,
as my lawful husband.

203
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:55,090
Do you take Joanie--

204
00:12:55,292 --> 00:12:56,361
See!

205
00:12:56,612 --> 00:13:01,322
But Joanie Ioved Chachi.
That's the difference.

206
00:13:03,092 --> 00:13:04,411
"Grab a spoon. "

207
00:13:04,652 --> 00:13:07,120
Do you know Iong it's been
since I grabbed a spoon?

208
00:13:07,652 --> 00:13:10,291
Do the words, " BiIIy, don't be
a hero," mean anything to you?

209
00:13:12,572 --> 00:13:16,850
You know, here's the thing. Even if
I couId get it together enough. . .

210
00:13:17,092 --> 00:13:18,923
. . .to ask a woman out. . .

211
00:13:19,892 --> 00:13:21,530
. . .who am I going to ask?

212
00:13:43,092 --> 00:13:44,161
Isn't this amazing?

213
00:13:44,412 --> 00:13:46,721
I have never made coffee
before in my Iife.

214
00:13:46,932 --> 00:13:49,366
-That is amazing.
-CongratuIations.

215
00:13:49,572 --> 00:13:53,724
If you feeI Iike you gotta make
a Western omeIet or something. . . .

216
00:13:56,812 --> 00:13:59,280
AIthough, actuaIIy
I'm reaIIy not that hungry.

217
00:14:01,172 --> 00:14:03,128
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

218
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:06,843
-Morning.
-Morning, PauI.

219
00:14:07,092 --> 00:14:09,925
-HeIIo, PauI.
-Hi. PauI, is it?

220
00:14:14,172 --> 00:14:16,322
I had a reaIIy great time Iast night.

221
00:14:16,972 --> 00:14:19,281
Thank you. Thank you so much.

222
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:20,925
We'II taIk Iater.

223
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:27,562
Thank you.

224
00:14:34,132 --> 00:14:36,123
That wasn't a reaI date.

225
00:14:37,412 --> 00:14:39,926
What the heII do you do
on a reaI date?

226
00:14:40,972 --> 00:14:43,122
Shut up and put my tabIe back.

227
00:14:44,492 --> 00:14:46,164
I've got to get to work.

228
00:14:46,412 --> 00:14:51,327
If I don't input those numbers,
it doesn't make much of a difference.

229
00:14:54,692 --> 00:14:56,762
So, Iike, you guys aII have jobs?

230
00:14:57,412 --> 00:14:59,164
Yeah, we aII have jobs.

231
00:14:59,372 --> 00:15:01,840
That's how we buy stuff.

232
00:15:03,372 --> 00:15:04,646
Yeah, I'm an actor.

233
00:15:04,852 --> 00:15:06,922
Have I seen you in anything?

234
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:09,367
I doubt it.
MostIy regionaI work.

235
00:15:09,572 --> 00:15:13,042
UnIess you happen to catch the
Wee One's production of Pinocchio.

236
00:15:13,252 --> 00:15:15,686
"Look, Geppeto. I'm a reaI Iive boy. "

237
00:15:18,412 --> 00:15:20,050
I wiII not take this abuse.

238
00:15:20,292 --> 00:15:22,123
You're right. I'm sorry.

239
00:15:22,532 --> 00:15:25,126
Once I was a wooden boy
A little wooden boy

240
00:15:29,132 --> 00:15:31,327
How are you doing today?
You sIeep okay?

241
00:15:31,572 --> 00:15:34,928
Did you taIk to Barry?
I can't stop smiIing.

242
00:15:35,412 --> 00:15:38,131
I see that. You Iook Iike you
sIept with a hanger in your mouth.

243
00:15:44,212 --> 00:15:47,329
I know. He's just so--

244
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:49,210
Remember you and Tony De Marco?

245
00:15:50,292 --> 00:15:52,931
WeII, it's Iike that.
With feeIings.

246
00:15:54,892 --> 00:15:56,530
Are you in troubIe!

247
00:15:57,532 --> 00:16:02,128
I'm going to get up, go to work,
and not think about him aII day.

248
00:16:02,812 --> 00:16:05,326
Or eIse I'm just going
to get up and go to work.

249
00:16:05,772 --> 00:16:07,444
-Wish me Iuck!
-What for?

250
00:16:07,652 --> 00:16:10,803
I'm gonna go get one
of those job things.

251
00:16:18,412 --> 00:16:20,846
-Hey, Monica.
-Hey, Franny. WeIcome back.

252
00:16:21,092 --> 00:16:22,445
How was FIorida?

253
00:16:22,692 --> 00:16:24,011
You had sex, didn't you?

254
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:26,762
How do you do that?

255
00:16:27,892 --> 00:16:29,450
So, who?

256
00:16:29,972 --> 00:16:31,451
You know PauI?

257
00:16:32,212 --> 00:16:33,565
PauI, the wine guy?

258
00:16:33,772 --> 00:16:35,285
Yeah, I know PauI.

259
00:16:37,812 --> 00:16:40,121
You mean, you know PauI
Iike I know PauI?

260
00:16:40,412 --> 00:16:42,528
Are you kidding?
I take credit for PauI.

261
00:16:42,772 --> 00:16:46,651
Before me, there was no snap in his
turtIe for two years.

262
00:16:49,812 --> 00:16:52,246
Of course it was a Iine.

263
00:16:52,572 --> 00:16:55,166
Why? Why wouId anybody
do something Iike that?

264
00:16:55,372 --> 00:16:58,330
We're Iooking for an answer
more sophisticated than. . .

265
00:16:58,572 --> 00:17:00,324
. . . " To get you into bed. "

266
00:17:01,412 --> 00:17:02,765
Is it me?

267
00:17:03,012 --> 00:17:06,448
Is it Iike I have some sort of
beacon that onIy dogs. . .

268
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:09,206
. . .and men with emotionaI
probIems can hear?

269
00:17:09,412 --> 00:17:11,243
Come here.
Give me your feet.

270
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,164
I just thought he was
nice, you know?

271
00:17:22,932 --> 00:17:25,321
I can't beIieve you
didn't know it was a Iine.

272
00:17:29,932 --> 00:17:30,728
Guess what?

273
00:17:30,972 --> 00:17:32,769
-You got a job?
-Are you kidding?

274
00:17:32,972 --> 00:17:34,644
I'm trained for nothing.

275
00:17:36,492 --> 00:17:38,323
I was Iaughed out of 1 2 interviews.

276
00:17:38,572 --> 00:17:40,005
You're surprisingIy upbeat.

277
00:17:40,212 --> 00:17:43,522
You wouId be too if you found
Joan and David boots on saIe. . .

278
00:17:43,732 --> 00:17:45,404
. . .50% percent off.

279
00:17:45,612 --> 00:17:47,330
How weII you know me.

280
00:17:48,932 --> 00:17:51,241
They're my " I don't need
a job or my parents.

281
00:17:51,492 --> 00:17:53,483
I've got great boots" boots.

282
00:17:54,812 --> 00:17:56,928
-How did you pay for them?
-Credit card.

283
00:17:57,492 --> 00:17:59,084
And who pays for that?

284
00:17:59,772 --> 00:18:01,683
My father.

285
00:18:04,172 --> 00:18:05,969
You can't Iive off your parents.

286
00:18:06,212 --> 00:18:09,522
I know that. That's why
I was getting married.

287
00:18:10,452 --> 00:18:12,966
Give her a break. It's hard being
on your own for the first time.

288
00:18:13,412 --> 00:18:14,811
-Thank you.
-You're weIcome.

289
00:18:15,012 --> 00:18:17,526
When I first came to
this city, I was 1 4.

290
00:18:17,772 --> 00:18:20,286
My mom had kiIIed herseIf
and my stepdad was in prison.

291
00:18:20,492 --> 00:18:22,369
And I got here,
and I didn't know anybody.

292
00:18:22,572 --> 00:18:27,327
I ended up Iiving with this aIbino
guy who was cIeaning windshieIds.

293
00:18:27,572 --> 00:18:29,528
And then he kiIIed himseIf.

294
00:18:30,612 --> 00:18:34,287
Then I found aromatherapy. BeIieve
me, I know exactIy how you feeI.

295
00:18:38,292 --> 00:18:40,931
The word you're Iooking for is:

296
00:18:41,492 --> 00:18:42,641
"Anyway. . . . "

297
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:49,482
-You ready?
-I don't think so.

298
00:18:49,692 --> 00:18:51,205
Cut. Cut.

299
00:18:51,412 --> 00:18:53,004
Cut, cut, cut.

300
00:18:58,892 --> 00:19:00,325
WeIcome to the reaI worId!

301
00:19:00,532 --> 00:19:02,090
It sucks.
You're gonna Iove it.

302
00:19:09,972 --> 00:19:11,530
That's it.

303
00:19:12,052 --> 00:19:13,167
You gonna crash on the couch?

304
00:19:13,372 --> 00:19:17,331
-No, I gotta go home sometime.
-Are you gonna be okay?

305
00:19:19,132 --> 00:19:20,963
Look what I just
found on the fIoor.

What?

307
00:19:24,812 --> 00:19:26,370
That's PauI's watch.

308
00:19:26,612 --> 00:19:28,921
You can just put it back
where you found it.

309
00:19:29,972 --> 00:19:32,122
Oh, boy! AII right.

310
00:19:32,612 --> 00:19:34,728
-Good night, everybody.
-Good night.

311
00:19:45,292 --> 00:19:46,247
-I'm sorry.
-No!

312
00:19:46,492 --> 00:19:48,926
-No, have it, reaIIy.
-SpIit it?

313
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:57,528
You probabIy didn't know this,
but back in high schooI I had. . .

314
00:19:57,932 --> 00:19:59,445
. . .a major crush on you.

315
00:20:00,812 --> 00:20:02,006

316
00:20:02,372 --> 00:20:03,521
You did?

317
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:08,165
I figured you thought I was
Monica's geeky oIder brother.

318
00:20:09,012 --> 00:20:10,331
I did.

319
00:20:15,292 --> 00:20:16,725
Listen, do you think--

320
00:20:17,052 --> 00:20:20,522
And try not to Iet my vuInerabiIity
become any kind of a factor here.

321
00:20:22,572 --> 00:20:25,325
Do you think it wouId be okay if
I asked you out sometime, maybe?

322
00:20:29,612 --> 00:20:30,886
Maybe.

323
00:20:38,212 --> 00:20:40,123

-Good night.
-Good night.

326
00:21:02,612 --> 00:21:03,681
Wait, wait.

327
00:21:03,892 --> 00:21:05,007
What's with you?

328
00:21:07,092 --> 00:21:09,128
I just grabbed a spoon.

329
00:21:17,972 --> 00:21:19,530
I can't beIieve what
I'm hearing.

330
00:21:19,772 --> 00:21:21,285
I can 't believe
What I'm hearing

331
00:21:21,492 --> 00:21:23,608

00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:38,726
-I'm just serving it.
